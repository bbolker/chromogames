- in the absence of color dynamics (i.e. b fixed to 0)
   - if we run Hawk-Dove in a well-mixed population (=no space=large neighbourhoods) do we get the expected frequency of hawks and doves given the payoffs?
   - if we run PD in a well-mixed population does defecting win regardless of starting frequencies?
   - if we increase spatial structure (make the neighborhood smaller) does everything get nicer in general (i.e. cooperation can persist in PD, frequency of doves goes up in H-D)

- time series graphs are (only) useful to convince ourselves that the system has actually equilibrated
- if we're comfortable that we're at equilibrium then we don't want to look at time series any more; computing the average "proportion of hawks and doves" (= the average value
