- if we run Hawk-Dove in a well-mixed population do we get the expected frequency of hawks and doves given the payoffs?
- if we run PD in a well-mixed population does defecting win regardless of starting frequencies?
- if we increase spatial structure (make the neighborhood smaller) does everything get nicer in general (i.e. cooperation can persist in PD, frequency of doves goes up in H-D)


- test to show that we get the same answer (for a=0) with and without recombination
- time series graphs are (only) useful to convince ourselves that the system has actually equilibrated
